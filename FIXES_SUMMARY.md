# Voice Kiosk Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve transcription and audio recording issues.

---

## Issue 1: Audio Device Not Specified in AudioRecorder

### Problem
The `AudioRecorder` class was not using the configured audio device (PCM2902). It was recording from the system default audio device, which produced silent audio files.

### Root Cause
- `audio_recorder.py`: Missing `device` parameter in `sd.InputStream()` call
- `subsystem_manager.py`: Not passing `audio_device` to AudioRecorder constructor

### Symptoms
- All recordings contained silence (RMS = 0)
- Whisper received silent audio and returned "You" (default fallback)
- Tests 4, 5, and 6 failed

### Fix Applied

**File: `audio_recorder.py`**
- Added `audio_device: Optional[int] = None` parameter to `__init__()` (line 21)
- Stored as `self.audio_device` (line 44)
- Added `device=self.audio_device` to `sd.InputStream()` (line 81)

**File: `subsystem_manager.py`**
- Added `audio_device=self.config.AUDIO_INPUT_DEVICE` when initializing AudioRecorder (line 218)

**File: `test_interactive.py`**
- Added `audio_device=self.config.AUDIO_INPUT_DEVICE` to all 3 AudioRecorder instantiations (lines 302, 371, 467)

### Verification
```bash
# Check recording now has audio data
python3 -c "
import wave, numpy as np
with wave.open('/tmp/voice_kiosk_recordings/recording_*.wav', 'rb') as wf:
    audio = np.frombuffer(wf.readframes(wf.getnframes()), dtype=np.int16)
    print(f'RMS: {np.sqrt(np.mean(audio.astype(np.float32) ** 2)):.1f}')
"
# Should show RMS > 0 (not 0)
```

## Issue 2: Audio Amplification Not Applied in AudioRecorder

### Problem
The `AudioRecorder` was recording audio but not applying amplification. The wake word detector had amplification (2.0x), but the recorder didn't, resulting in audio too quiet for Whisper to transcribe.

### Root Cause
- `audio_recorder.py`: No amplification support
- PCM2902 raw output: RMS ~2493 (good for wake word with 2.0x amp)
- Recorded files: RMS ~441 (too quiet for Whisper without amplification)

### Symptoms
- Audio files recorded correctly (not silent)
- Whisper detected audio duration and language
- Whisper transcribed 0 segments (audio too quiet)
- Test 6 (End-to-End Pipeline) failed with empty transcription

### Fix Applied

**File: `audio_recorder.py`**
- Added `amplification: float = 1.0` parameter to `__init__()` (line 22)
- Stored as `self.amplification` (line 45)
- Apply amplification during recording loop (lines 103-107):
  ```python
  if self.amplification != 1.0:
      amplified_chunk = chunk.astype(np.float32) * self.amplification
      amplified_chunk = np.clip(amplified_chunk, -32768, 32767).astype(np.int16)
  else:
      amplified_chunk = chunk
  ```
- Store amplified audio in buffer
- Use amplified audio for silence detection (RMS calculation)

**File: `subsystem_manager.py`**
- Added `amplification=self.config.AUDIO_AMPLIFICATION` when initializing AudioRecorder (line 219)

**File: `test_interactive.py`**
- Added `amplification=self.config.AUDIO_AMPLIFICATION` to all 3 AudioRecorder instantiations (lines 303, 372, 468)

### Verification
```bash
# Check recording now has proper RMS
python3 << 'EOF'
import wave, numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

recordings = sorted(Path("/tmp/voice_kiosk_recordings").glob("*.wav"),
                   key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime, reverse=True)
if recordings:
    with wave.open(str(recordings[0]), 'rb') as wf:
        audio = np.frombuffer(wf.readframes(wf.getnframes()), dtype=np.int16)
        rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio.astype(np.float32) ** 2))
        print(f"RMS: {rms:.1f}")
        print(f"Expected: ~{2493 * 2.0:.1f} (raw RMS × amplification)")
        print(f"Status: {'✅ Good' if 2000 <= rms <= 30000 else '❌ Bad'}")
EOF
```

Expected output:
```
RMS: 4986.0
Expected: ~4986.0 (raw RMS × amplification)
Status: ✅ Good
```

## Issue 3: No Delay After Wake Word Detection (UX Issue)

### Problem
In the End-to-End Pipeline test, users needed to pause between saying the wake word and their command. Without a pause, the tail end of "hal" would be captured at the start of the recording.

### Example
```
User says: "hal what time is it"
            ^^^← detected here
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^← recording captures "al what time is it"
```

### Fix Applied

**File: `test_interactive.py`**
- Added 300ms delay after wake word detection (line 513):
  ```python
  print("   ✓ Wake word detected!")

  # Brief delay to allow wake word to finish being spoken
  await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

  # Step 2: Record command
  print("\n🎤 Step 2: Recording your command...")
  ```

### Recommendation for Production
Add configurable delay to `.env`:
```bash
WAKE_WORD_POST_DETECTION_DELAY=0.3
```

Then use in your main application event loop.

---

## Configuration Summary

### Working Configuration (.env)
```bash
# Audio Device
AUDIO_INPUT_DEVICE=2                  # PCM2902 USB audio device

# Audio Amplification
AUDIO_AMPLIFICATION=2.0               # Optimized for this PCM2902 unit
                                      # (raw RMS ~2493 → amplified ~4986)

# Recording Thresholds
RECORDING_SILENCE_THRESHOLD=2000      # Works with amplified audio
RECORDING_SILENCE_DURATION=1.5        # Seconds of silence to stop
RECORDING_MAX_DURATION=30             # Max recording length

# Wake Word
WAKE_WORD=hal
WAKE_WORD_SIMILARITY=0.6              # Detection sensitivity
WAKE_WORD_MODEL_PATH=./models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15

# Whisper STT
WHISPER_MODEL=tiny.en
WHISPER_DEVICE=cpu
WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8

# Sample Rate
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=48000
AUDIO_CHANNELS=1
AUDIO_CHUNK_SIZE=4096
```

### Key Hardware Details
- **Microphone**: PCM2902 USB Audio Codec
- **Raw RMS**: ~2493 (much higher than typical PCM2902)
- **Amplification needed**: 2.0x (not the typical 300x)
- **Amplified RMS**: ~4986 (perfect for speech detection)

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files
1. **audio_recorder.py**
   - Added `audio_device` parameter (line 21)
   - Added `amplification` parameter (line 22)
   - Apply amplification to chunks (lines 103-113)
   - Pass device to stream (line 81)

2. **subsystem_manager.py**
   - Pass `audio_device` to AudioRecorder (line 218)
   - Pass `amplification` to AudioRecorder (line 219)

### Test Files
3. **test_interactive.py**
   - Added `audio_device` to 3 AudioRecorder instances
   - Added `amplification` to 3 AudioRecorder instances
   - Added 300ms delay after wake word detection (line 513)

### No Changes Needed
- **test_unit.py**: All 40 tests still pass ✅

```

---

## How to Verify Everything Works

### 1. Run Unit Tests
```bash
python3 test_unit.py
# Expected: Ran 40 tests in ~0.1s, OK (skipped=2)
```

### 2. Run Interactive Tests
```bash
python3 test_interactive.py
# Expected: 6/6 tests pass
```

### 3. Check Audio Levels
```bash
python3 quick_mic_test.py
# Expected: Raw RMS ~2493, recommended amp ~1.0-2.0x
```

### 4. Verify Recording Quality
```bash
# Record and check most recent file
python3 << 'EOF'
import wave, numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

rec = sorted(Path("/tmp/voice_kiosk_recordings").glob("*.wav"),
            key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)[-1]

with wave.open(str(rec), 'rb') as wf:
    audio = np.frombuffer(wf.readframes(wf.getnframes()), dtype=np.int16)
    rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio.astype(np.float32) ** 2))

    print(f"File: {rec.name}")
    print(f"RMS: {rms:.1f}")
    print(f"Status: {'✅ Good (2000-30000)' if 2000 <= rms <= 30000 else '❌ Too quiet/loud'}")
EOF
```

---

## Maintenance Notes

### If Tests Start Failing

1. **Check amplification settings**:
   ```bash
   grep AUDIO_AMPLIFICATION .env
   # Should be 2.0 for your PCM2902
   ```

2. **Verify device is connected**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"
   # Device 2 should be PCM2902
   ```

3. **Run diagnostics**:
   ```bash
   python3 diagnose_audio.py
   # Follow recommendations
   ```

### If You Change Hardware

If you replace the PCM2902 with a different microphone:

1. Run `python3 quick_mic_test.py` to measure raw RMS
2. Adjust `AUDIO_AMPLIFICATION` in `.env`:
   - Raw RMS ~50: Use 300.0 (typical low-gain USB mic)
   - Raw RMS ~500: Use 30.0
   - Raw RMS ~2500: Use 2.0 (your current PCM2902)
   - Raw RMS ~10000: Use 1.0 (high-gain mic)
3. Run `python3 test_interactive.py` to verify
